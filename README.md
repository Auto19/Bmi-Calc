# Bmi-Calc
A BMI Calculator that can calculate BMI for both Imperial and Metric systems. Designed for Phones

This project was made before I knew how github worked. So instead of using commits to track updates I used an update pattern.  The project actually came around though because I doctor I knew needed a quick way to show patents their BMI.  He also needed to be able to show them how much they needed to weigh so that he could operate on them, hence the BMI 30 and 35 calculator.
